# 1. How long is the sequence used during exercise 1.1 (in seconds)?
#    - 1s lol
# 2. Whatâ€™s the resolution of event timestamps?
#    - Hard to tell what the resolution is, the average can be calculated, the max also could be calculated - simple maths
# 3. What does the time difference between consecutive events depend on?
#    - It depends on the event sensor's sampling rate and the motion characteristics of objects in the scene.
# 4. What does positive/negative event polarity mean?
#    - Positive events correspond to brightness increases, while negative events correspond to brightness decreases.
# 5. What is the direction of movement of objects in exercise 1.2?
#    - The scatter plot shows that they are moving along the x-axis, towards positive values of it
